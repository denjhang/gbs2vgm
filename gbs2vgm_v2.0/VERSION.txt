GBS2VGM Version 2.0
Release Date: 2026-02-04
Build: Release

Major Changes in v2.0:
======================

1. Fixed GBS file support for different memory mappings
   - Fixed replayer code address conflicts
   - Now correctly handles Tales of Phantasia and other high-load-address GBS files
   - Automatic safe replayer code positioning

2. Fixed VGM loop point calculation
   - Complies with VGM v1.71 standard and libvgm specification
   - Correctly sets total_samples (samples before loop) and loop_samples (loop section samples)
   - Loop points now marked at song beginning, not in the middle

3. Fixed loop playback behavior
   - VGM players can now correctly loop and jump to next track after loop count
   - File sizes significantly reduced (DQ1&2: 11MB→4.8MB, Tales: 18MB→7.8MB)

4. Implemented cycle-accurate timing
   - Based on CPU cycles for precise timing, not fixed time steps
   - Sample-accurate delays for each register write
   - No timing drift using 64-bit arithmetic

5. 60Hz refresh rate
   - 17ms time steps, closer to actual Game Boy frame rate
